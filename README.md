### Some Notes About this Repository
I realize this is not the "correct" way to use git, but in the interests of not cluttering my GitHub page with tons of small, relatively meaningless repositories they have all been consolidated here.

To that effect each folder (at least for the classes taken at Kent State) represents an SVN repository that was used for submitting work. I've tried to only include those files necessary to be committed rather than the entire project submissions (especially in the case of submitting images, PDFs, compiled project files, etc).
